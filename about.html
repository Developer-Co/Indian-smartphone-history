                Indian SmartPhone History
            </h1>
            <p class="content-1">
                It all started in 1995 when India’s first-ever mobile phone call was made between Kolkata and New Delhi.
                At present, 25 years later, India is the world’s second-largest smartphone market.

                    Eventhough the Cellular (Mobile) Phones were introduced in 1983, It was only on July 1995, the
                    mobile network was introduced In India. The first commercial cellphone and service launch was in
                    July 1995 — so we were quite a few years behind at the time. It was a partnership between the Modi
                    Group and Australian telecom operator Telstra that brought the first cellular network to India.

                            The mobile giant, Nokia introduced its 5110 model phone and it became very popular all over
                            India. It had 6 colours with interchangeable back and front panels. This phone had a battery
                            attached with the back panel.

                            It had a long antenna and it can be folded. This was not just a phone, but a member in every
                            owner’s family. I can proudly say that my father’s first phone was this one and he had a
                            Orange
                            colour phone. The snake game became addicted to anyone who plays it aleast once.

                            The upgraded version of this phone was released on 2001 and it had a internal antenna and it was small and compact compared to the older version. Soon the rate of cell phones and network tariffs went down and it became a major blow for Pagers. Eventually Motorolla, stoped manufacturing Pagers in 2003 and started releasing phones in India. In the same year, Nokia 3310 was released and the antenna was placed inside the phone. This was light in weight compared to Nokia 5110.
                            After that Nokia was placed first in India’s most trusted mobile brand continuously for 12 years.
